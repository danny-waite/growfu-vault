# META ADS SYSTEM ENGINEERING FRAMEWORK

> A unified system for building Meta Ads as a **learning and allocation machine** — integrating creative, auction, delivery, and scaling into one operational framework.

## Framework Philosophy

[[../05-REFERENCE/Introduction-Learning-System-Philosophy|Read the Introduction → The Learning System Philosophy]]

> Meta does not "choose ads." It allocates impressions by optimizing predicted outcomes under constraints. Your job is to create **learnable, stable, stage-appropriate creative systems** that produce:
- high predicted action probability (for the right people),
- low predicted negative experience,
- minimal policy/integrity risk,
- stable signals that the delivery system can confidently scale.

A central rule of this framework:

If you change the system’s meaning, you did not “iterate.” You created a different system.

This rule is enforced through structural variables (PS, OF, BR, etc.), semantic consistency, stage discipline, and governance protocols.
