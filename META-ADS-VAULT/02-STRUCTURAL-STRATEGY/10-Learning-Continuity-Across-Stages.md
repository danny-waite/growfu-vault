## Campaigns Must Form a Progression, Not Isolated Islands

If each stage campaign feels like a different brand, you destroy:
- Trust continuity in the user
- Embedding coherence in the system
- Attribution integrity across the funnel

---

## 10.1 What Is Inherited Between Stages

Between stages you **must preserve:**

| Element | Why It Matters |
|---|---|
| **Core promise** | The user must feel they are progressing with the same offer, not encountering a new brand |
| **Language** | Key words and phrases must remain consistent. The system uses language as a meaning signal. |
| **Creative identity** | Visual style, tone, and production quality — the ad's latent identity (A embedding) must feel continuous |
| **Quality discipline** | Never drop quality standards at a new stage just because a different audience is targeted |

> [!rule] If You Change the Thesis, You Break Continuity
> A user who experienced an Exploration-stage ad that promised "clarity" must see that same clarity thesis carried forward into Identification and Validation stages.

---

## 10.2 What Must NOT Be Inherited Blindly

Do **not** carry forward between stages:

| Element | Why It Is Dangerous |
|---|---|
| **Aggressive CTAs prematurely** | A "Buy Now" CTA in Identification-stage content increases rejection signals from users not yet ready |
| **Over-strong claims** | Claims appropriate for Validation-stage trust may be unearned at Exploration stage |
| **A different causal mechanism** | If the mechanism you propose changes between stages, users sense inconsistency and disengage |

> Each stage must feel like **natural progression**, not a new pitch.

---

## 10.3 Bridge Creatives

Bridge creatives are designed specifically to **smooth the transition** between stages. They maintain embedding continuity while advancing the user's cognitive state.

| Transition | Bridge Creative Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Exploration → Identification** | INSIGHT creative that ends with mechanism curiosity. Opens the door to the framework. |
| **Identification → Validation** | FRAMEWORK creative that builds initial trust in the solution approach. |
| **Validation → Decision** | SYSTEM creative that reduces remaining friction. Converts established trust into action. |

> [!rule] Bridge Creatives Maintain Embedding Continuity
> The latent identity (A embedding) of bridge creatives must overlap meaningfully with both the stage they exit and the stage they enter. Abrupt transitions read as new campaigns to the system.

## Learning Continuity Checklist

Before advancing a user audience to the next stage, verify:

- [ ] Core promise is unchanged
- [ ] Key language terms are carried forward
- [ ] Visual / tonal identity is consistent
- [ ] CTA intensity is appropriate for the new stage
- [ ] Bridge creative is in place before hard cutover
- [ ] Previous stage performance is stable (not declining)
