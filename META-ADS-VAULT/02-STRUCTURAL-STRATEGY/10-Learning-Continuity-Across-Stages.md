## Campaigns Must Form a Progression, Not Isolated Islands

If each stage campaign feels like a different brand, you destroy:
- Trust continuity in the user
- Embedding coherence in the system
- Attribution integrity across the funnel

---

## 10.1 What Is Inherited Between Stages

Between stages you **must preserve:**

| Element | Why It Matters |
|---|---|
| **Core promise** | The user must feel they are progressing with the same offer, not encountering a new brand |
| **Language** | Key words and phrases must remain consistent. The system uses language as a meaning signal. |
| **Creative identity** | Visual style, tone, and production quality — the ad's latent identity (A embedding) must feel continuous |
| **Quality discipline** | Never drop quality standards at a new stage just because a different audience is targeted |

> [!rule] If You Change the Thesis, You Break Continuity
> A user who experienced an Exploration-stage ad that promised "clarity" must see that same clarity thesis carried forward into Identification and Validation stages.

---

## 10.2 What Must NOT Be Inherited Blindly

Do **not** carry forward between stages:

| Element | Why It Is Dangerous |
|---|---|
| **Aggressive CTAs prematurely** | A "Buy Now" CTA in Identification-stage content increases rejection signals from users not yet ready |
| **Over-strong claims** | Claims appropriate for Validation-stage trust may be unearned at Exploration stage |
| **A different causal mechanism** | If the mechanism you propose changes between stages, users sense inconsistency and disengage |

> Each stage must feel like **natural progression**, not a new pitch.

---

## 10.3 Bridge Creatives

Bridge creatives are designed specifically to **smooth the transition** between stages. They maintain embedding continuity while advancing the user's cognitive state.

| Transition | Bridge Creative Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Exploration → Identification** | INSIGHT creative that ends with mechanism curiosity. Opens the door to the framework. |
| **Identification → Validation** | FRAMEWORK creative that builds initial trust in the solution approach. |
| **Validation → Decision** | SYSTEM creative that reduces remaining friction. Converts established trust into action. |

> [!rule] Bridge Creatives Maintain Embedding Continuity
> The latent identity (A embedding) of bridge creatives must overlap meaningfully with both the stage they exit and the stage they enter. Abrupt transitions read as new campaigns to the system.

## Learning Continuity Checklist

Before advancing a user audience to the next stage, verify:

- [ ] Core promise is unchanged
- [ ] Key language terms are carried forward
- [ ] Visual / tonal identity is consistent
- [ ] CTA intensity is appropriate for the new stage
- [ ] Bridge creative is in place before hard cutover
- [ ] Previous stage performance is stable (not declining)

## Verification Status

> This section documents the verification status of key claims and assumptions in this note. Confidence scores reflect the strength of available evidence from Meta official sources, academic research, and industry validation.

| Claim/Assumption | Type | Confidence | Evidence | Impact | Notes |
|-----------------|------|------------|----------|--------|-------|
| Isolated campaigns destroy embedding coherence | E | 7 | Semantic consistency supports learning; changing core semantics changes latent identity; [Meta Engineering](https://engineering.fb.com/2024/11/19/data-infrastructure/sequence-learning-personalized-ads-recommendations/) | Risk: HIGH \| Benefit: MAJOR<br>Inconsistent campaigns waste previous learning. Coherent progression compounds knowledge. | Cross-reference: File 4 semantic consistency (confidence 7) |
| System uses language as meaning signal | E | 8 | Embeddings encode text semantics; language is component of multimodal ad representation; [Multimodal Embeddings](https://towardsdatascience.com/multimodal-embeddings-an-introduction-5dc36975966f/) | Risk: MEDIUM \| Benefit: SUBSTANTIAL<br>Language changes alter ad embedding. Consistent language maintains semantic identity. | Cross-reference: File 4 multimodal embedding (confidence 8) |
| Ad's latent identity (A embedding) must feel continuous | E | 7 | Creative identity emerges from structure and signals; consistency maintains identity; practitioner consensus | Risk: HIGH \| Benefit: MAJOR<br>Identity shifts read as new campaigns, restarting learning. Continuity preserves accumulated knowledge. | Cross-reference: File 4 creative identity (confidence 7) |
| Aggressive CTAs prematurely increase rejection signals | E | 7 | pHide/pReport increase from stage-inappropriate CTAs; quality signals affect delivery | Risk: MEDIUM \| Benefit: SUBSTANTIAL<br>Premature CTAs create negative signals. Stage-appropriate CTAs maintain quality. | Cross-reference: File 3 quality signals (confidence 8), File 7 CTA-stage alignment (confidence 7) |
| Abrupt transitions read as new campaigns to the system | E | 7 | Embedding-based systems respond to semantic shifts; discontinuity prevents learning transfer | Risk: HIGH \| Benefit: MAJOR<br>Abrupt shifts restart learning cycle. Smooth transitions enable learning continuity. | Logical extension of semantic consistency (confidence 7) |
| Core promise, language, visual identity must be preserved | D | 7 | Semantic and visual consistency supports stable ad representation; practitioner best practice | Risk: HIGH \| Benefit: MAJOR<br>Inconsistency destroys brand recognition and learning continuity. Consistency enables compounding effects. | Synthesis of semantic consistency (File 4, confidence 7) + quality discipline |
| Bridge creatives maintain embedding continuity | C/E | 6 | Framework concept; underlying behavior: gradual semantic transition plausible for continuity | Risk: MEDIUM \| Benefit: SUBSTANTIAL<br>Hard cutoffs may disrupt attribution and recognition. Bridges smooth transitions. | Framework tool (bridge creatives = N/A); underlying continuity principle = confidence 6 |
| Attribution integrity across funnel | E | 6 | Attribution windows exist; consistent user journey improves attribution; practitioner understanding | Risk: MEDIUM \| Benefit: SUBSTANTIAL<br>Disconnected campaigns make attribution unclear. Consistent journey improves tracking. | Attribution windows verified (File 1); cross-campaign attribution less documented |
| Trust continuity in the user | C | N/A | Framework concept about user experience | Risk: N/A \| Benefit: N/A<br>User psychology consideration | Framework UX principle; not directly Meta system mechanic |
| Quality discipline must not drop between stages | D | 8 | Historical quality affects future ads; quality degradation compounds negatively; account quality history | Risk: HIGH \| Benefit: MAJOR<br>Quality drops create cascade negative effects. Maintained quality preserves account health. | Cross-reference: File 4 historical priors (confidence 8) |
| Different causal mechanism between stages causes disengagement | C/E | 5 | Framework principle; user confusion plausible but not directly verified in Meta context | Risk: MEDIUM \| Benefit: MODERATE<br>Mechanism shifts may confuse users. Consistency improves clarity. | Framework messaging principle; user experience logic but unverified |
| Learning continuity checklist elements | C | N/A | Framework operational tool | Risk: N/A \| Benefit: N/A<br>Framework's transition management checklist | Framework guidance for implementing continuity principles |

**Verification Key:**
- **Type:** A=Factual Technical, B=Operator Mental Model, C=Framework Construct, D=Operational Best Practice, E=Causal Assertion
- **Confidence Scale:** 1-2=Unverified, 3-4=Speculative, 5-6=Reasonably Inferred, 7-8=Well Supported, 9-10=Verified
- **Last Updated:** 2026-02-21

**Important Distinctions:**
- **Bridge Creatives (Type C):** Framework tool/concept (not Meta terminology)
- **Underlying Continuity Mechanics (Type E, Scored):** Semantic consistency, embedding coherence, quality history - WELL VERIFIED
- **User Experience Principles (Type C, N/A):** Trust, messaging consistency - framework UX concepts

**Key Finding:**
Learning continuity principles are built on verified Meta mechanics:
- Semantic consistency affects learning (confidence 7)
- Language/visual changes alter embeddings (confidence 7-8)
- Quality history affects future performance (confidence 8)
- CTA-stage alignment prevents negative signals (confidence 7)

Framework provides structure (bridge creatives, checklists) around proven behavior.
