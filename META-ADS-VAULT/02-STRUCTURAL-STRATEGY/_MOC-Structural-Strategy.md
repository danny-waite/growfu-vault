# Part II — Structural Strategy

> **Map of Content** | [[../00-INDEX/HOME|← HOME]]
> *If Part I is the machine, Part II is the blueprint you feed into it.*

## Purpose

This part defines everything you must lock down **before you build ads or campaigns.** These are the invariant inputs — the structural controls that govern what the learning system learns, and whether it can learn stably.

> [!rule] The Blueprint Must Precede the Build
> Most campaign failures originate here: operators skip structural definition and go directly to creative. The result is a system that cannot learn because its inputs are undefined or inconsistent.

## Key Concepts in This Part

- [[07-Immutable-Global-Variables|PS, OF, BR]] — The trinity that defines the system. If any change, it is a new system.
- [[09-Cognitive-Stages-and-Optimization-Contracts|Cognitive Stages]] — Exploration → Identification → Validation → Decision
- [[../05-REFERENCE/Glossary-and-Acronyms|S0 / S1]] — Behavioral (not psychological) state definitions
- The "optimization contract" — what you declare to the system you want to maximize

## The Non-Negotiable Rule

> [!rule] System Identity Rule
> If [[../05-REFERENCE/Glossary-and-Acronyms|PS]], [[../05-REFERENCE/Glossary-and-Acronyms|OF]], or [[../05-REFERENCE/Glossary-and-Acronyms|BR]] change, it is not an iteration. **It is another system.**
