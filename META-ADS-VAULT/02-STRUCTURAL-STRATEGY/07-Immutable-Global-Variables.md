# 7 — Immutable Global Variables

## The Structural Controls That Govern Learning

These variables are **not "per ad."** They define the learning system.

They exist to prevent the most common failure:
> Random variation that changes meaning, destroys learnability, and creates false learning.

Lock all 9 variables before creating any creative or campaign.

---

## 7.1 Problem Space (PS)

[[../05-REFERENCE/Glossary-and-Acronyms|PS]] is a recurring human error — cognitive, emotional, or behavioral.

**Requirements:**
- Identify the dominant structural cause (do not blame the user).
- Define it as a repeatable, observable pattern.

**PS must be expressible as:**
- 1 sentence definition
- 3 observable symptoms (behaviors)

> Example: "Operators launch ads without defining structural variables first [PS], resulting in inconsistent creative briefing [symptom 1], poor learning [symptom 2], and wasted budget [symptom 3]."

---

## 7.2 Outcome Function (OF)

[[../05-REFERENCE/Glossary-and-Acronyms|OF]] is **not aspiration.** It is an observable state transition.

**Requirements:**
- Describe what the user *does* differently after your intervention.
- Express as change in behavior, criteria, or action.

> Not: "Users will feel more confident."
> Yes: "Users will evaluate options using a defined framework rather than guessing."

---

## 7.3 Brand Role (BR)

[[../05-REFERENCE/Glossary-and-Acronyms|BR]] is the functional brand–user relationship, defined by:

| Dimension | Options |
|---|---|
| Direction | Unidirectional / Bidirectional |
| Intensity | Low / Medium / High |
| Position | Above / Beside / Behind |

**BR governs:**
- what proof is required,
- how strong the CTA can be,
- what tone is credible.

> A brand positioned "beside" the user (peer/guide) cannot use authoritative top-down tone. A brand positioned "above" cannot use casual peer tone.

---

## 7.4 Cognitive Stage (CS)

[[../05-REFERENCE/Glossary-and-Acronyms|CS]] defines where the user is in their learning journey:

**Stages:** Exploration → Identification → Validation → Decision

CS determines:
- objective,
- acceptable message type,
- acceptable CTA,
- optimization event,
- targeting style.

## 7.5 Value Expression Type (VE)

[[../05-REFERENCE/Glossary-and-Acronyms|VE]] defines the type of message. **Closed set — one per campaign:**

| # | VE | Stage Alignment |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **INSIGHT** — reframes the problem | Exploration |
| 2 | **VALIDATION** — normalizes the error | Exploration / Identification |
| 3 | **FRAMEWORK** — organizes the problem | Identification |
| 4 | **SYSTEM** — step-by-step execution | Validation / Decision |

> [!rule] One campaign = one dominant VE.
> Mixing VE types inside a campaign creates semantic ambiguity. The system cannot learn what kind of creative this is.

---

## 7.6 Emotional Axis (EA)

[[../05-REFERENCE/Glossary-and-Acronyms|EA]] defines the emotional transition the creative facilitates.

Examples:
- confusion → clarity
- insecurity → confidence
- overwhelm → control

**Rules:**
- Defined per campaign.
- **Never mixed within a campaign.**

> A campaign cannot simultaneously move users from "overwhelm → control" and "fear → hope." Pick one axis and hold it.

---

## 7.7 Abstraction Level (AL)

[[../05-REFERENCE/Glossary-and-Acronyms|AL]] controls how conceptual vs. concrete the creative is.

| Content Type | AL Range |
|---|---|
| Content (organic) | High / Medium |
| Ads | Medium / Low |

AL ensures your ad stays learnable and stage-appropriate. Early-stage (Exploration) ads can be more abstract. Decision-stage ads must be concrete and action-oriented.

---

## 7.8 CTA Intensity Range (CTA-R)

[[../05-REFERENCE/Glossary-and-Acronyms|CTA-R]] defines how strong you can push the call-to-action without breaking coherence.

Constrained by:
- Stage (the dominant constraint)
- Brand role
- Trust level established

See [[09-Cognitive-Stages-and-Optimization-Contracts#9.4 CTA Intensity per Stage|CTA intensity per stage]] for ranges.

---

## 7.9 Semantic Consistency Rules (SCR)

[[../05-REFERENCE/Glossary-and-Acronyms|SCR]] defines what **cannot change** without creating a new system:

- Core promise
- Language (specific words and phrases)
- Immutable theme
- Claim limits (what cannot be promised)

> Example SCR: "We never claim a specific revenue figure. We never imply the process is effortless. All creatives use the word 'system.'"

---

## The Non-Negotiable System Rule

> [!rule] The System Identity Rule
> **If PS, OF, or BR change, it is not an iteration. It is another system.**
>
> Start over. Do not try to "evolve" a system by changing its foundational inputs. Create a new one and let the old one finish its lifecycle.
