## You Do Not Scale Ads. You Scale Portfolios.

A single ad — no matter how strong — will fatigue, saturate, and eventually die. A well-structured portfolio allows you to rotate, refresh, and explore without breaking the learning the system has accumulated.

---

## Portfolio Structure

A stable portfolio contains four functional clusters:

| Cluster | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Core Control Creative** | The best-performing proven creative. Anchor for all comparison. Never modified — only retired. |
| **Variation Cluster A** | Hook variations of the core control. Same thesis, different opening. |
| **Variation Cluster B** | Emotional or visual framing variations. Same thesis, different angle. |
| **Exploratory Cluster** | New creative families being tested. May fail — that's the point. |

---

## What Each Cluster May Vary

| Element | Control | Variation A | Variation B | Exploratory |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Hook | Fixed | Varies | Fixed | Free |
| Emotion | Fixed | Fixed | Varies | Free |
| Example / Story | Fixed | Fixed | Varies | Free |
| Narrative order | Fixed | Fixed | Varies | Free |
| Visual framing | Fixed | Fixed | Varies | Free |

## What NEVER Varies Across the Portfolio

> [!rule] Immutable Across All Portfolio Clusters
> - Core promise
> - [[../05-REFERENCE/Glossary-and-Acronyms|PS]] (Problem Space)
> - [[../05-REFERENCE/Glossary-and-Acronyms|OF]] (Outcome Function)
> - [[../05-REFERENCE/Glossary-and-Acronyms|BR]] (Brand Role)
> - [[../05-REFERENCE/Glossary-and-Acronyms|VE]] (Value Expression Type)
> - [[../05-REFERENCE/Glossary-and-Acronyms|EA]] (Emotional Axis)
>
> If any of these change, the creative belongs to a **different campaign system**, not this portfolio.

## Creative Identity Management

Each portfolio has a **latent creative identity** — a cluster in embedding space that the system has learned to associate with specific user behaviors. This identity is built over time through consistent signals.

To maintain that identity:
- Production style must stay consistent across clusters
- Tone must match the declared [[../05-REFERENCE/Glossary-and-Acronyms|EA]]
- Language must follow [[../02-STRUCTURAL-STRATEGY/07-Immutable-Global-Variables|SCR]]
- Claim levels must stay within approved limits

> An "exploratory" creative that uses a radically different visual style or tone is not exploring variation — it is seeding a new identity that will confuse the system's learning.

---

## Portfolio Lifecycle

```
Exploratory → Control Candidate → Control → Fatiguing → Retired
```

| Phase | Action |
|---|---|
| **Exploratory** | Run with small budget allocation. Monitor micro-signals. |
| **Control Candidate** | Performance matches or exceeds control. Promote. |
| **Control** | Lead allocation. Do not modify. |
| **Fatiguing** | Watch time declines, CVR softens. Begin Variation A/B refresh. |
| **Retired** | Rising negative signals. Remove. Never resurrect. |

---

## Portfolio Size Guidelines

| Stage | Recommended Portfolio Size |
|---|---|
| Exploration | 3-5 active creatives |
| Identification | 3-5 active creatives |
| Validation | 2-4 active creatives |
| Decision | 2-3 active creatives (highest specificity required) |

> Fewer, higher-quality creatives outperform larger portfolios of inconsistent quality.
