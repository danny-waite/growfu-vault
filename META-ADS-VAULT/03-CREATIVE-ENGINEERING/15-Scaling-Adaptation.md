## What Changes When You Scale

Scaling is not "more of the same." When you increase spend, the system expands into **less aligned user embeddings** — users who are progressively more distant from your core audience in latent space.

| At Low Spend | At Scale |
|---|---|
| Specific, high-alignment creatives win | You must generalize to reach broader audiences |
| [[../05-REFERENCE/Glossary-and-Acronyms|CPA]] is at or near floor | CPA rises (marginal expansion) |
| Tight creative specificity works | Over-specific framing excludes too many users |
| Small portfolio is sufficient | Portfolio diversity becomes critical |

## 15.1 Why CPA Rises With Scale (It Is Not Failure)

As you scale:
- The system expands into progressively less-aligned user embeddings
- These users have lower average conversion probability
- This naturally increases marginal [[../05-REFERENCE/Glossary-and-Acronyms|CPA]]

> [!rule] Rising CPA at Scale Is Expansion Physics, Not Failure
> This is the natural result of serving users who are less aligned with your offer. The appropriate response is **gradual creative generalization** — not panic edits.

See [[../04-OPERATIONAL-CONTROL/19-Competitive-Density-and-Marginal-CPA|Competitive Density & Marginal CPA]] for the full dynamics.

## 15.2 Creative Generalization (Not Dilution)

As you scale, you must widen creative framing **without breaking the core thesis.**

| Acceptable Generalization | Unacceptable Dilution |
|---|---|
| Broaden the example pool (more relatable scenarios) | Change the core promise |
| Widen the problem description (more people can see themselves) | Change [[../05-REFERENCE/Glossary-and-Acronyms|PS]] or [[../05-REFERENCE/Glossary-and-Acronyms|OF]] |
| Soften the specificity of language slightly | Change [[../05-REFERENCE/Glossary-and-Acronyms|EA]] (emotional axis) |
| Add new social proof from broader audience segments | Change [[../05-REFERENCE/Glossary-and-Acronyms|VE]] (value expression type) |

> The thesis stays fixed. The framing broadens incrementally.

## 15.3 Scaling Checklist (Pre-Scale Decision)

Before increasing budget significantly, verify:

- [ ] Stage is fully stabilized (performance has plateaued, not declining)
- [ ] Event density is sufficient (learning phase complete)
- [ ] [[../05-REFERENCE/Glossary-and-Acronyms|CPA]] stable across 7+ consecutive days
- [ ] No rising negative feedback signals
- [ ] Budget increase planned at < 30% increment
- [ ] Portfolio has diversity to survive audience expansion (not one creative)
- [ ] Generalization variants are ready if CPA rises post-scale

→ Full scaling checklist also in [[../04-OPERATIONAL-CONTROL/22-Master-Checklists-and-Execution-Templates|Master Checklists]].

## 15.4 Portfolio Diversity at Scale

A single creative, even a strong one, cannot sustain scale. As audience expands:

- Different sub-segments respond to different hooks
- Frequency pressure on any single creative accelerates fatigue
- The system needs variation to maintain allocation efficiency

> [!rule] Build Generalization Variants Before You Need Them
> Do not wait until CPA spikes to start building broader framing variants. Prepare them as you approach scale thresholds so they are ready to deploy without disrupting learning.
