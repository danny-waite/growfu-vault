## Fatigue Is Not Just Frequency

A common mistake: treating fatigue as a simple frequency problem ("we've shown this ad too many times"). Fatigue is a more precise phenomenon with a distinct cause, signature, and solution.

> **Fatigue** = decreasing marginal utility under repeated exposure.
> **Saturation** = increased rejection signals under repeated exposure.

These are **different conditions** requiring different interventions.

## Definitions

| State | Definition | Primary Signal |
|---|---|---|
| **Stabilization** | Normal performance plateau — no trend either direction | Flat [[../05-REFERENCE/Glossary-and-Acronyms|CPA]], flat engagement |
| **Fatigue** | Performance slowly declines; quality signals remain stable | CVR drop, declining completion rate, stable hide/report |
| **Saturation** | Negative feedback rises | Hide rate ↑, report ↑, negative feedback ↑, CVR drops significantly |

---

## 20.1 Frequency Tolerance Per Stage

Frequency tolerance (how many exposures before fatigue/saturation) varies by stage because the emotional stakes differ:

| Stage | Frequency Tolerance | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Exploration** | Higher — 3-6+ exposures | Low commitment content; curiosity can tolerate repetition |
| **Identification** | Medium — 2-4 exposures | More personal content; repetition starts to feel intrusive |
| **Validation** | Lower — 2-3 exposures | Trust content; over-exposure can feel pressuring |
| **Decision** | Lowest — 1-2 exposures | High-commitment ask; urgency loses credibility with repetition |

## 20.2 Diagnosis Protocol

Before acting, diagnose correctly:

### Step 1: Check the signal pattern

| Signal | Stabilization | Fatigue | Saturation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Watch time / hold rate | Flat | Declining | Declining |
| CVR | Flat | Declining slowly | Dropping significantly |
| CTR | Flat | Flat or slightly declining | May spike as only curious users click |
| Hide / Report | Flat | Flat | **Rising** ← defining signal |
| CPA | Flat | Rising slowly | Rising rapidly |

### Step 2: Confirm the pattern holds over time
One bad day is noise. A 5-7 day trend is signal. See [[21-Governance-and-Change-Management#21.3 Minimum Observation Windows|Minimum Observation Windows]].

## 20.3 Intervention Rules

| Diagnosis | Intervention |
|---|---|
| **Stabilization** | No action required. Monitor. Continue running. |
| **Fatigue** | Refresh hook or visual within [[../02-STRUCTURAL-STRATEGY/07-Immutable-Global-Variables\|semantic tolerance]] ([[../05-REFERENCE/Glossary-and-Acronyms\|SCR]]). Do NOT change [[../05-REFERENCE/Glossary-and-Acronyms\|PS]], [[../05-REFERENCE/Glossary-and-Acronyms\|OF]], or [[../05-REFERENCE/Glossary-and-Acronyms\|EA]]. |
| **Saturation** | **Pause.** Rotate to a different creative family. Or shift context window (exclusion list, audience reset). |

> [!rule] Never Change PS/OF Mid-Fatigue
> The temptation during fatigue is to "fix" the campaign by changing what it's about. This does not solve fatigue — it destroys accumulated learning and creates a new system with zero history.

## 20.4 Rotation Protocol

When rotating creative:

1. **New creative must be ready before the old one is retired** — never create a gap
2. **Rotation must stay within portfolio identity** — new creative carries the same [[../05-REFERENCE/Glossary-and-Acronyms|VE]] and [[../05-REFERENCE/Glossary-and-Acronyms|EA]]
3. **Exploratory creatives should be in-flight before you need them** — build pipeline proactively
4. **Retired creatives are never resurrected** — they carry saturated signal history

---

## Fatigue Monitoring Checklist

Review weekly (or sooner during scaling):

- [ ] Watch time / completion rate trending down over 5+ days?
- [ ] CVR declining without corresponding CTR drop?
- [ ] Hide / report rising over 5+ days?
- [ ] [[../05-REFERENCE/Glossary-and-Acronyms|CPA]] rising without budget or audience changes?
- [ ] New exploratory creative ready in pipeline?
