# Part IV — Operational Control

> **Map of Content** | [[../00-INDEX/HOME|← HOME]]
> *How to operate without breaking learning.*

---

## Purpose

This is the execution layer. Part IV covers everything that happens after the system is live: how to manage budget, attribution, competitive pressure, fatigue, governance, and daily operational decisions — without destroying the learning the system has accumulated.

> [!rule] The Most Common Advanced Advertiser Error
> Most experienced operators damage their systems not through ignorance of strategy, but through **impulsive operational decisions** — changing too much, too fast, based on incomplete data. This part exists to prevent that.

## Daily Use Priority

For day-to-day campaign management, prioritize:

1. **[[22-Master-Checklists-and-Execution-Templates|Master Checklists]]** — pre-launch, change, scaling
2. **[[20-Fatigue-Saturation-and-Rotation|Fatigue & Rotation]]** — is creative decaying?
3. **[[21-Governance-and-Change-Management|Governance]]** — what am I allowed to change right now?
4. **[[17-Budget-Variance-and-Stability|Budget & Stability]]** — is delivery stable?
