## Creative Performance Is Necessary. Signal Stability Is Critical.

A creative that performs well but generates unstable signals will not scale. The system needs **consistent, predictable signal density** to allocate budget with confidence.

## 17.1 Budget as Learning Fuel

Budget must:
- Buy sufficient optimization events (enough to exit learning phase)
- Produce consistent signal density
- Avoid starving learning (too low) or overwhelming the audience (too high)

### Too Low Budget:
- Conversion events become sporadic
- Variance increases
- Delivery confidence drops
- The system cannot learn what kind of user converts

### Too High Budget Too Quickly:
- Audience expands too aggressively
- [[../05-REFERENCE/Glossary-and-Acronyms|CPA]] spikes
- Marginal users dilute performance
- Learning becomes unstable

> [!rule] Scaling Must Be Gradual
> Increase budget in increments ≤ 20-30% per adjustment. Larger increases reset pacing confidence and can trigger re-entry into the learning phase.

## 17.2 Variance Management

High variance harms delivery. Sources of variance:

| Source | Why It Creates Variance |
|---|---|
| Inconsistent creative messaging | The system cannot build a stable prediction model |
| Poor landing coherence | Post-click behavior is unpredictable |
| Narrow audiences | Small audiences exhaust quickly, causing delivery instability |
| Sudden budget changes | Pacing algorithms are disrupted |
| Skipping cognitive stages | Users who can't convert add noise to the conversion signal |

> [!rule] CTR Spikes + CVR Collapse = Variance
> Hooks that generate curiosity without payoff create the most dangerous variance pattern. The system sees high click-through and low conversion, which it interprets as unpredictable supply quality.
>
> Variance signals uncertainty. Uncertainty reduces allocation confidence.

## 17.3 Learning Phase Discipline

During the learning phase (~50 optimization events threshold), avoid:

| Action | Why It Is Harmful |
|---|---|
| Editing ads mid-learning | Resets the ad's prediction history |
| Changing optimization event | Invalidates all accumulated learning |
| Large abrupt budget shifts (> 20-30%) | Disrupts pacing and can reset learning phase |
| Turning ad sets on/off repeatedly | Creates incoherent signal density |

> [!rule] One Variable Change Per Iteration
> Every change resets at least part of the system's learning. Governance rule: one variable change per iteration, and only after the minimum observation window has been reached.

## 17.4 Stability Signals to Monitor

Track these to detect stability problems before they become crises:

| Signal | Healthy | Warning | Problem |
|---|---|---|---|
| Daily CPA variance | < 15% day-over-day | 15-30% | > 30% |
| Delivery consistency | Spend within 10% of target | Occasional > 15% gaps | Repeated significant under/over-delivery |
| Negative feedback trend | Flat or declining | Gradual rise | Spike |
| CVR trend | Stable or improving | Declining slowly | Cliff drop |
