## The Core Premise

This framework is designed to run Meta Ads as what it truly is: **a learning and allocation system.**

Meta does not "choose ads."
It allocates impressions by optimizing predicted outcomes under constraints.

That means:

- Your job is **not** to create "good ads."
- Your job is to create **learnable, stable, stage-appropriate creative systems** that produce:
  - high predicted action probability (for the right people),
  - low predicted negative experience,
  - minimal policy/integrity risk,
  - stable signals that the delivery system can confidently scale.

## The Four Integrated Layers

| Layer | Part | What It Covers |
|---|---|---|
| System Physics | [[../01-SYSTEM-PHYSICS/_MOC-System-Physics\|Part I]] | What the machine is, how it scores, allocates, and learns |
| Structural Strategy | [[../02-STRUCTURAL-STRATEGY/_MOC-Structural-Strategy\|Part II]] | What you must define before you build anything |
| Creative Engineering | [[../03-CREATIVE-ENGINEERING/_MOC-Creative-Engineering\|Part III]] | How to design creatives the machine can learn from efficiently |
| Operational Control | [[../04-OPERATIONAL-CONTROL/_MOC-Operational-Control\|Part IV]] | How to operate without breaking learning |

## The Central Rule

> [!rule] The Central Rule of This Framework
> **If you change the system's meaning, you did not "iterate." You created a different system.**
>
> This rule is enforced through structural variables ([[../02-STRUCTURAL-STRATEGY/07-Immutable-Global-Variables|PS, OF, BR]], etc.), semantic consistency, stage discipline, and governance protocols.

This rule has a practical consequence for every decision you make:

- Changing a hook = iteration (if [[Glossary-and-Acronyms|PS/OF/BR]] stay stable).
- Changing the emotional axis = new system.
- Changing the optimization event mid-learning = destroys attribution.
- Changing the core promise = new system.
