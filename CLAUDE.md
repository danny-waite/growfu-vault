# GrowFu v3 Specification

Contains a knowledge-base of all GrowFu concepts and documentation. This is the main reference for all things GrowFu, including architecture, design principles, and implementation details. It serves as a comprehensive guide for developers, contributors, and users of the GrowFu framework.

It is an Obsidian vault, which means it is organized in a way that allows for easy navigation and linking between related concepts. Each concept is documented in its own markdown file, and these files are interconnected through links to create a cohesive knowledge base.
